# Billing.py
This code is a simple Customer Billing System designed in Python to help users calculate the total bill for each customer in a shopping scenario. It allows the cashier to input a customer's name and phone number, then adds multiple items to the bill based on their price and quantity.
Key Features:
Loop Structure for Multiple Customers: The outer while loop enables handling multiple customers consecutively.
Itemized Billing: The inner loop allows the cashier to enter multiple items for a single customer, calculating the cost by multiplying the price and quantity of each item.
Total Calculation: The code sums up each item's total to provide a final amount payable by the customer.
User Prompts and Customization: After each item entry, it asks whether more items should be added, and upon completion of a customer's bill, displays a thank-you message.
This code demonstrates the use of nested loops, input handling, and basic arithmetic operations, making it ideal for small retail or shop settings where quick, itemized billing is required.
